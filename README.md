What is Relativity?
Is a web-based application, accessible from almost all browsers. It is used for data governing.
It is a robust tool, that could :
- Sending legal hold notices.
- Processing data.
- Running searches.
- Coding documents.
- Exporting productions.
-Administrating users'  documents.

The main space where documents will be listed is the workspace ( we will have a project for the workspace)
Users can be admins, viwers or project managers.

There are features available for everyone. 

To edit or change setting there is a user account in the upper left corner that can be used.

To change the user setting user can click on my setting and make the changes:

To update the password, the user can select update password:

Usually, an organization set a single sign-in and a secure password update for extra security measures.

This was the basics of launching and changing the user setting menu.

See you in the next project!
